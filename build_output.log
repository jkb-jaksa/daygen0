transforming...

/noise.png referenced in /noise.png didn't resolve at build time, it will remain unchanged to be resolved at runtime
✓ 2366 modules transformed.
✗ Build failed in 4.98s
error during build:
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "wavesurfer.js" from "/Users/jakubst/Desktop/daygen-project/daygen-frontend/src/components/shared/MusicSelector.tsx".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
